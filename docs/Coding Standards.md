 - **Code Structure:**
•	Organize code logically into packages, classes, and methods.
•	Avoid large methods; break them into smaller, focused functions.


2. Variable Naming:
•	Use meaningful and descriptive variable names.
•	Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., camelCase).


3. Code Reusability:
•	Promote code reusability by creating utility classes or methods.
•	Avoid duplicating code; favor modular and reusable components.


4. File Header Comments:
•	Each file should begin with a comprehensive header comment block.
•	Include copyright information, license details, and a brief description of the purpose of the file.
•	The SPDX-License-Identifier should specify the license type.


5. Package and Class Comments:
•	Each Java package and class should have a descriptive comment.
•	Clearly state the purpose and functionality of the package or class.

6. Annotations and Formatting:
•	Use meaningful annotations for code clarity (e.g., @Entity, @Table).
•	Follow a consistent indentation and formatting style to enhance code readability.


7. Method Comments and Documentation:
•	Include comments for each method describing its purpose.
•	Document parameters, return types, and any exceptions thrown.
•	Use descriptive method names.


8. Exception Handling:
•	Implement appropriate exception handling where necessary.
•	Clearly state exceptions thrown and their potential causes.
