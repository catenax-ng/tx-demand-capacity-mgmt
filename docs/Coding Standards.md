 - **Code Structure:**
   - Organize code logically into packages, classes, and methods.
   - Avoid large methods; break them into smaller, focused functions.(One function for the single method)

 - **Variable Naming:**
   - Use meaningful and descriptive variable names.
   - Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., camelCase).


 - **Code Reusability:**
   - Promote code reusability by creating utility classes or methods.
   - Avoid duplicating code; favor modular and reusable components.


 - **File Header Comments:**
   - Each file should begin with a comprehensive header comment block.
   - Copyright information, license details, and a brief description of the purpose of the file.
   - The SPDX-License-Identifier should specify the license type.


 - **Package and Class Comments:**
   - Each Java package and class should have a descriptive comment.
   - Clearly state the purpose and functionality of the package or class.

 - **Annotations and Formatting:**
   - Use meaningful annotations for code clarity (e.g., @Entity, @Table).
   - Follow a consistent indentation and formatting style to enhance code readability.


 - **Method Comments and Documentation:**
   - Use descriptive method names.
   - Avoid methods with more than one function.

 - **Exception Handling:**
   - Implement appropriate exception handling where necessary.
   - Clearly state exceptions thrown and their potential causes.
